## Action Items from May 2016 Meeting

> Jan doesn’t have any leads for doing a water pourer training for Magidah. 

Action: Lauri will look up Jen’s info, the woman’s name and get it to Jan. Jan will continue to look as well.


> Jan: Update on Shift Network and Video progress; need for pictures.

__Action:__ Karen will check with Anji and Payton to see if they have the one of her with the planets moving around her. All else look for woo woo pictures. Put your name on it for credit.

> Jan: My biggest concern is in the scripting. In class things are front-loaded with information and then journeys for two days. I’ve had to break the information up in ways that each video has a little bit of info and experiential learning and discussion.

__Action:__ Jan will send the scripts to Pamela to read through and give suggestions.

> Pamela: Regarding Lara. Mary Boyd talked with her. For Lara, it might be better for all for her to be able to use it. When she is around spiritual energy it can trigger her seizures. Marijuana dampens it in her system. 

__Action:__ Pamela will check to see if she is willing to do edibles. Also to let her know that this is between the council and her. Will ask for something written from her for the North. Will also talk with Mary that she’ll be her buddy.

> Jan: I talked to Julius. Karen: I talked with him today and he will be there regardless of the dog. He’s all good and is coming.

__Action:__ Karen will let Julius know no dog.

> Questers and Primaries:  there is a concern about Lucas being AWOL.

__Action:__ Jan will make the final call about whether he is questing. 

> Pamela: Since Karen and Jan missed the pre-practicum info, the need for more support for Jan. 

__Action:__ Jan will follow through with the crystal for the land. Remind the medicine wheel leads to hold Jan energetically.

> Karen: Some of the questers from last year want to know when to burn their yellow ties?

> Jan: My recommendation would be that they be there if possible, but if not, they can have a ceremonial fire for themselves. If they are going to be on the land, they can do it right after the sacred fire is lit. 

__Action:__ Karen will make sure they know when they are burning the yellow ties (sweat lodge at the end, making their own, doing it on the land). MJ is reaching out to last year’s questers to see how they are doing.

> Karen: We need a recruiting program. There are a lot of new people, and with the Shift there is going to be a lot different. We might have virtual assistants, assisting Jan from their living rooms.

__Action:__ Create a subcommittee to brainstorm about how to recruit people to be assistants and the programs.

> Margie: Scholarship request for Amber Mitchell. 

__Action:__ Margie will tell her she is approved for a Level 1 scholarship for the fall weekend.

> Policies for events/notifications by Associate Teachers and others

__Action:__ Pick up discussion about the policy in August meeting after practicum. Put it at the beginning of the meeting  Karen will bring a proposal for her trip to Egypt.


> Jan: The Bulletin Board policy is also part of this discussion. Let’s be ahead of the curve versus catching up.
> Karen: These policies are going to have to do with marketing and promotion.

__Action:__ Block non-LightSong people on Facebook Bulletin Board… Karen will find out who the admin is and do it.

__Action:__ Karen will draft a document of possible policies that need to be addressed and get a start on it.

__Action:__ Margie will block Marie Anderson from bulletin board. Karen will look into how to create policy for Facebook.

> MJ ShD

__Action:__ Go back through the Sh.D. checklist requirements and how I perceive my requirements for the kitchen responsibilities to have been met and bring it back to the council.
